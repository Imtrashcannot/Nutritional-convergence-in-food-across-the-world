# Nutritional-convergence-in-food-across-the-world

The main goal of this curiosity mini-research was to see if we can use unsupervised learning method to simply cluster the food around the world.
For this project, I specifically chose Asia and Europe.

At first, the cluster became so considering all the food's nutritional characteristics are mixed.

There, I realized something deeper, is it because of globalization?

So, let's enjoy a mini journey through our code for us to discover the identity of food around the world and the effect of globalization to nutritions.
